    <h3>Today, we will be learning about text fonts and styles.</h3>
    <h4>Are you ready?</h4>
    <p>As you can see, we changed the background color of the page in the body via "style".</p>
    <hr>
    <p>(what a lovely color!)</p>
    <hr>
    <p style="font-size: 35px;"> Look, I am so big!</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: brown;">Look, I am italic AND brown!</p>
    <p style="color: rgb(198, 54, 102); font: bold; font-style: italic;">Hmm, I am starting to understand the logic...
    </p>
    <p>Now I want a brake, I will write a poem;</p>
    <h3>Hope</h3> <small> by Emily Dickinson</small>
    <p> <i>Hope</i> is the thing with feathers <br>
        That perches in the <b>soul</b>, <br>
        And sings the tune without the words, <br>
        And never stops <i><b>at all.</b></i> </p>
    <hr>
    <p>But wait, I would not want to keep adding "br" to every sentence! Is there another easy way of doing this? I
        think so!</p>
    <p style="background-color: cadetblue;">Let's try again:</p>
    <pre style="font-size: 15px;">
    And <i>sweetest in the gale</i> is heard; 
And sore must be the <b>storm</b>
    That could abash the little bird
That kept so many <i><b>warm</b></i>.</pre>
    <p>Do not forget pre is about lining! It is about keeping the text, just as we copied or wrote it! If you write
        sentences as a paragraph, they will appear as such, even though you wanted them to look as in a poem!</p>
    <p><strong>Tricky</strong>? <mark style="background-color: darkolivegreen;">Not</mark> so much if you ask me...</p>
    <p>Ok, the colors are just tiring at this point! </p>
    <p style="color: cornflowerblue;"> <i>See you in the next one!</i></p>
